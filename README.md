    _  AN ELEGY Dr. Johnſon obſerves, that this Elegy abounds with images which find a mirrour in every mind, and with ſentiments to which every boſom returns an echo. The four ſtanzas beginning, Yet ev'n theſe bones are, ſays he, original: I have never ſeen the ſentiments in any other place; yet he that reads them here, perſuades himſelf that he has always felt them. WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCH YARD,

      * The EPITAPH.

    _ HYMN to ADVERSITYAn imitation, as Dr. Johnſon obſerves, of the 35th Ode of the firſt book of Horace, beginning, O Diva, gratum quae regis Antium; but Mr. Gray has excelled his original, by the variety of his ſentiments, and by their moral application..

    _ EDUCATION. A POEM: IN TWO CANTOSOne canto only of this poem was publiſhed. The objections that were made to the obſolete words are ſaid to have occaſioned its being left unfiniſhed.. Written in Imitation of the Style and Manner of SPENSER's FAIRY QUEEN. Inſcribed to Lady LANGHAMLady Langham was the author's mother., Widow of Sir JOHN LANGHAM, Bart.

      * CANTO I.

    _ PENSHURSTNear Tunbridge. The name of this ſeat denotes its ſituation to be in a woody country, which is the extremity of the Weald of Kent; to which Mr. Waller has alluded,Embroider'd ſo with flow'rs where ſhe ſtood,That it became a garden of a wood.In the reign of King Edward the VIth, it was forfeited to the Crown by its former proprietor; and granted by that prince to Sir William Sidney, Lord Chamberlain of his Houſhold.. INSCRIBED TO WILLIAM PERRY, Eſq AND The Honourable Mrs. ELIZABETH PERRYOne of the co-heireſſes of the Sidney family, niece to the laſt Earl of Leiceſter, and married to William Perry Eſquire..

    _ TO THE Hon. WILMOT VAUGHANNow Lord Liſburne., in WALES.

    _ AN EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO Sir THOMAS HANMERA ſtateſman of diſtinguiſhed merit, and a polite writer. He was deſcended from a very ancient family in North Wales, and was born in 1676. In the year 1712 he was choſen Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, and died in May, 1746, ſoon after the publication of his edition of Shakſpeare. Dr. Johnſon obſerves that he was a man eminently qualified for ſuch ſtudies as that which occaſioned the preſent epiſtle. He had (as the ſame author remarks) what is the firſt requiſite to emendatory criticiſm, that intuition by which the poet's intention is immediately diſcovered, and that dexterity of intellect which diſpatches its work by the eaſieſt means. He had undoubtedly read much; his acquaintance with cuſtoms, opinions, and traditions, ſeems to have been large; and he is often learned without ſhew. He ſeldom paſſes what he does not underſtand, without an attempt to find or to make a meaning, and ſometimes haſtily makes what a little more attention would have found. He is ſolicitous to reduce to grammar, what he could not be ſure that his author intended to be grammatical. Shakſpeare regarded more the ſeries of ideas than of words; and his language not being deſigned for the reader's deſk, was all that he deſired it to be, if it conveyed his meaning to the audience. Preface to Shakſpeare, p. 46., On his EDITION of SHAKSPEARE's WORKS.

    _ VERSES to Dr. GEORGE ROGERSDr. George Rogers was the ſon of a phyſician in the city of London. He received his education at Lincoln college, Oxford, took his degrees in Arts, and ſtudied medicine in that univerſity. He afterwards travelled into Italy, and at Padua had the degree of Doctor of Phyſick conferred upon him. In 1648 he was incorporated at Oxford. He then ſettled in London, became a Fellow of the College of Phyſicians, and Preſident thereof, in 1689. This little poem was, among ſeveral others, on the ſame occaſion, printed by Dr. Rogers, with his inaugural exerciſe at Padua; and afterwards in the ſame manner re-publiſhed by him at London, together with his Harveian oration before the college of phyſicians, in the year 1682; while Mr. Waller was yet living., on his taking the Degree of Doctor in Phyſic at PADUA, in the Year 1664.

    _ VIRGIL's TombAt about eight miles diſtance from Naples, near the hill Pauſilypo. A modern traveller deſcribes it thus: The tomb of Virgil is at the brink of a precipice, which has been made by enlarging the entrance into the famous grotto which bears the name of the hill. The area is almoſt a ſquare, of about five yards; there are ſome niches in the walls within, but nothing now in them. At the top of it, on the outſide, are ſome bays; and the people there take care to tell you they grow ſpontaneous, and that they are green all the year. There is a wretched diſtich inſcribed on a wall juſt over againſt the place where we enter, enough to fright away Virgil's aſhes, if ever they were there.Wright's Travels, vol. I. p. 175. Mr. Addiſon was of opinion, that the poet was buried at Naples, and that his tomb ſtood on the other ſide of the town, which looks towards Veſuvio.. NAPLES, 1741.
